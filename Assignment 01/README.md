# Applied-Machine-Learning

Hi, I hope you are doing well.

Here I explore and implement a neural network using the Fashion MNIST dataset, a more challenging alternative to the classical MNIST dataset. 
This work provides me hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and analyzing performance on a more complex dataset.

Thank you, 
Diego Plata.
