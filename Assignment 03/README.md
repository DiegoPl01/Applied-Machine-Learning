# Applied-Machine-Learning

Hi, I hope you are doing well.

Here I focus on exploring fundamental concepts in image processing and neural networks. I implementing convolution operations on images to enhance features like edges and lines, using custom Python functions and standard kernels. Additionally I design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. On this project I emphasized  on preprocessing techniques, model architecture design, and experimentation with hyperparameters to optimize performance while addressing challenges like overfitting.

Thank you, 
Diego Plata.
