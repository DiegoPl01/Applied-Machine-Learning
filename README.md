# Applied-Machine-Learning

Hi, I hope you are doing well.

For whomever it is reading this, on this repository you will find compilation of my personal works related to Machine learning from scratch. 
From having hands-on experience on exploring & implementing a neural network using the Fashion MNIST dataset to exploring fundamental concepts
in image processing and neural networks, & to implement convolution operations on images to enhance features like edges and lines using custom
Python functions and standard kernels. I hope you enjoy trying them on your personal devices. 

Thank you, 
Diego Plata.
